## Age Calculator: Privacy policy

Welcome to the My MAC (My Age Calculator) app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Keshav Kumar. The source code is available on GitHub under the GNU AGPL license (3.0 or later).

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

## Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have programmed this app to collect 2 personally identifiable information mentioned below:

| Personally Identifiable Information | Use                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Name                                | Display your (user) name in app |
| Date of Birth                       | Calculate your (user) age       |


All data created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.
